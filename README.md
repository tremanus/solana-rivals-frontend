## Features

### ðŸ”— Wallet Integration & Customization

> **Users begin by connecting their Solana wallets using a sleek wallet adapter. Once in, they enter an interactive onboarding process where they tailor their agentâ€™s trading behavior based on on-chain analysis and market analytics. For instance, if youâ€™re all about tracking whale wallet activity, you can assign a higher weight to that factorâ€”ensuring your agent primarily copies large-scale trades.**


### ðŸŽ® Gamified Experience & Leaderboards

>**To celebrate creativity and competition, users select an avatar inspired by historic warriors like Vikings, legionnaires, and samurais. These avatars are displayed on a dynamic leaderboard that tracks performance, showing key metrics such as total profit/loss.**

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Agent Swarm

Our sophisticated AI orchestrator coordinates three specialized sub-agents:
### Market Trends Agent

### Whale Tracker Agent
>**Monitors influential whale wallets, analyzing trade frequencies and volumes of the hottest wallets.**

### Data Cruncher Agent
